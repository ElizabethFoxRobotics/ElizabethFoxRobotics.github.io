<p> I am Elizabeth Fox, currently a Research Scientist in robotics at Applied Research Associates.  In the Summer of 2023 I completed my PhD in Robotics from Georgia Tech with my dissertation on simultaneous design and control optimization in robotic grasping.
</p>
    
<p>   
My interests are primarily in design optimization, motion planning, and automation, in particular with regards to robotic grasping and manipulation.

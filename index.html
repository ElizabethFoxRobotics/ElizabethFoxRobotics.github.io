<h2> Project 6 / Deep Learning</h2>

<h3> Untrained Network </h3>
<p> Running the code as given gave 27% accuracy.  Adding randomly mirrored images increased the
accuracy to 32%, and zero-centering the images increased it further to 40%.  Adding in dropout
regularization actually decreased the accuracy slightly, to 39%.  Adding in another convolution/max
pool step in the middle, with some tuning, increased the accuracy to 42%.  When batch normalization
was added, normalizing the first two of three convolution layers, the process time increased from
200 seconds to 230 seconds, and the accuracy increased to 45%.  Increasing the learning rate at this point to 0.001
increased the time to 312 seconds and increased the accuracy to 51%.  Increasing the number of epoches to 100
increased the time to 493 seconds and increased the accuracy to 54%.  Figure 1 shows the filter visualizations for
the ten filters learned through the process, and Figure 2 shows the plots of the accuracies of the test and validation
sets over the epochs.
</p>


<h3> Trained Network </h3>
<p> The first training round, setting up the system as instructed, with 10 epoches as provided
in the starter code, took 1555 seconds and gave 88.3% accuracy. Figure 3 shows the filter visualizations for
the sixty-four filters learned through the process, and Figure 4 shows the plots of the accuracies of the test and validation
sets over the epochs.  Training with only 5 epochs took 1102 seconds and gave 85.9% accuracy. Training each epoch of the pre-trained
network took longer, and the overall process took longer; however, the accuracy was much higher than from the from-scratch network,
and it likely would have taken at least as much computational time to get comparable accuracies from scratch.

I am Elizabeth Fox, currently a Robotics Ph.D student at Georgia Tech.  My interests are in robotic grasping and manipulation, particularly in the design and control aspects, and more broadly I am interested in mechanics, design optimization, motion planning, and automation.

I plan to graduate in May or June of 2023, and I am currently seeking a job in industry, ideally in robotics research and development positions related to robotic grasping and manipulation.

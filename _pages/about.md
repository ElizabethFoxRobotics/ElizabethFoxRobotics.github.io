I am Elizabeth Fox, currently a Research Scientist in robotics at Applied Research Associates.  In the Summer of 2023 I completed my PhD in Robotics from Georgia Tech with my dissertation on simultaneous design and control optimization in robotic grasping.
    
My interests are primarily in design optimization, motion planning, and automation, in particular with regards to robotic grasping and manipulation.

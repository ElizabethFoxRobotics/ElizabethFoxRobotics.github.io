I am Elizabeth Fox, currently a Robotics Ph.D student at Georgia Tech.  My interests are in robotic grasping and manipulation, particularly in the design and control aspects, and more broadly I am interested in mechanics, design optimization, motion planning, and automation.

I hope to graduate within the next year, after which I am seeking jobs in industry, ideally in robotics research and development positions.
